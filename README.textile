h1. MD Hide Smileys

Hide Smileys under every Textarea in the EE Control Panel.

I made this simply to hide the "Smileys" link underneath each textarea on a Control Panel publish page. You can disable Emoticons in the admin, but I donâ€™t think there is any native way to hide this link without an extension.
